B&ouml;rm Bruckmeier Publishing was founded in 1992 in Munich, Germany, by two medical doctors, Dr. Philipp B&ouml;rm and Dr. Andreas Bruckmeier.<br/>The core philosophy of the company, which is now also based in El Segundo, California, is to produce medical content that is as concise as possible and consistently oriented to customers needs. This is achieved by reducing verbiage and making extensive use of graphical and tabular presentation and special formats (pocket books, pocket cards, and PDA software).<br/>B&ouml;rm Bruckmeier products are primarily designed for medical students and medical doctors. They are of great help for all other medical professionals as well. We hope you will enjoy working with our products.<br/>If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact us.<br/><br/>Your B&ouml;rm Bruckmeier Team
